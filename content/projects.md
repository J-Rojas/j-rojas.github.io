      Description: A data visualization application oriented towards multi-model engineering and scientific datasets. I built this tool using Python, Typescript, Vue with integration with ROS. I have used this during my robotics research for visualizing real time and pre-recorded sensor and algorithm outputs, but have adapted it for other related tasks, including as an extension to Python Notebooks for data science research and customizable dashboards.

      Description: Our team was interested in augmentation of vehicles for autonomous vehicle research. Our effort was focused on reverse-engineering the control systems to allow autonomous steering and speed control a vehicle. My major individual contribution was successfully adding support for a new vehicle (Hyundai Sonata) and demonstrating autonomous control using Arduino and ROS along with a sensor suite of cameras, GNSS-RTK, radar. Our team's effort was published in the [New York Times](https://archive.is/UdxRY).

      Description: "I helped lead a team of 10 fellow students in Udacity's autonomous vehicle coursework to develop a sensor fusion algorithm to detect cars and pedestrians using Didi Chuxing's datasets. We trained a convolutional neural net using multi-modal data: camera images, 360 degree and overhead lidar views. We submitted our work into a global competition and our team scored in the top 20 of over 200 teams worldwide."

      Description: "A vehicle path planning algorithm I developed that searches for viable, safe, and comfortable trajectories for simulated highway driving. The technique use higher-order curve fitting to prioritize comfort and safety by constraining acceleration and jerk during lane changes and speed adjustments and to secondly optimize for speed. The code was written in C++ and the project runs in a randomized highway simulator."

## Projects

The research projects presented below are derived from my interest in the autonomous systems. Although I drew some background context from previous MOOC courses, these projects are entirely self-initiated and exploratory in nature. Through these projects, I have honed my research skills and ability to experiment, achieve goals, and thrive under uncertain conditions. While my research experience primarily revolves around autonomous vehicles, I am eager to broaden my horizons and explore other related topics.
