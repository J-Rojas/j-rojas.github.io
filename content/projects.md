      Description: A data visualization tool oriented towards multi-model engineering and scientific datasets. I built this tool using Python, Typescript, Vue with integration with ROS. I have used this during my robotics research for visualizing real time and prerecorded data, but have adapted it for other visualization and application related tasks.

      Description: This is a robotics project enabling augmention of consumer vehicles for autonmous vehicle research. Our effort was focused on reverse-engineering the control systems to allow full autonomous control a vehicle. I successfully researched and developed support for a new vehicle (Hyundai Sonata).  We were able to demonstrate autonmous control of steering and vehicle speed using Arduino and ROS along with a sensor suite of cameras, GNSS-RTK, radar. Our team's effort was published in the [New York Times](https://archive.is/UdxRY).

      Description: "I helped lead a team of 10 fellow students in Udacity's autonomous vehicle coursework to apply their knowledge to a multi-sensor fusion project to detect cars and pedestrians using Didi Chuxing's datasets. We trained a convolutional neural net using multi-modal data: camera images, 360 degree and overhead lidar views. We submitted our work into a global competition and our team scored in the top 20 of over 200 teams worldwide."

      Description: "A vehicle path planning algorithm I developed that searches for potential trajectories using higher-order curve fitting to prioritize comfort and safety during lane changes and speed adjustments and secondly optimize for speed down the road. The project runs in a randomized highway simulator. The code was written in C++."

## Projects

The research projects presented below are derived from my interest in the field of autonomy. Although I drew some background context from previous MOOC courses, these projects are entirely self-initiated and exploratory in nature. Through these projects, I have honed my research skills and ability to experiment, achieve goals, and thrive under uncertain conditions. While my research experience primarily revolves around autonomous vehicles, I am eager to broaden my horizons and explore other related topics.
