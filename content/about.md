## About Me

I am a Master's degree student studying Computer Science at **University of Texas at Austin** and also have a Bachelor's in CS from **University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign**. I've worked in industry as a software engineer creating software solutions in various domains (enterprise hardware, IoT, robotics, gaming, cloud services). I am currently working towards pursuing a thesis and working in the domain of autonomous systems using machine learning. My strengths for research lie in my curiousity and willingness to characterize and determine why something works the way it does, and to experiment with new ideas regardless if they might fail. Aside from this, I also like sharing my knowledge and offer my assistance to my peers.
