## About Me

I am a Master's degree student of **Computer Science at the University of Texas at Austin**. Additionally, I hold a Bachelor's degree in **Computer Science from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign**. With several years of industry experience as a software engineer, I have gained expertise in diverse domains such as enterprise hardware, IoT, robotics, gaming, and cloud services.

At present, I am focused on thesis research with UT Austin VITA Group researching sparse LLM and Vision models, particularly on the subject of Mixture of Experts. My research strengths lie in my innate curiosity to understand the underlying mechanisms of systems and willingness to experiment with novel ideas. Moreover, I enjoy sharing my knowledge and am always willing to provide assistance to my peers.
